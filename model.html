				<h1>Modeling with me: what to expect.</h1>
					<h2>To begin, I would like to thank you for considering to work with me.</h2>
					
					<p>Feel free to review <a class="portfolioLink" href="portfolio.php">my portfolio.</a></p>
					<p>This is a primer to the experience if I had approached you regarding modeling for me.</p>
                    <p>I have eyes for talent and am always looking for models of both genders and many walks of life.</p>
                    
                    <p>Volunteer modeling is the most common. Chances are very good that if you have been approached by me, this is what was in mind. This is unpaid work for a gift print.</p>
                    <p>There is also modeling for a fee. This usually occurs when I have paid work that fits a model.</p>
                    <p>For paid work I always look to the models that have worked with me as volunteers first as they am most important to me at a number of levels.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here am some of the things that happen at every photography shoot:</p>
              <ol>
                        <li>You will be asked for proof of age. When a model is under the age of 18, parents or guardians must be made aware of the event, sign a release, and be invited to inspect the shoot.</li>
                        
                        <li>You have the right to refuse any pose. You will be treated with respect at all times and I assume responsibility for your safety.</li>
                        
                        <li>Before the shoot you will be given the opportunity to ask questions. Communication is highly important. The model- release contract will be explained to you. Again, if you have any questions, please ask them. </li>
                        
                        <li>After the I shoot you will be paid and will be asked to sign a release. Signing the release is to allow me to use the images as I need.</li>
                        
                        
                        <li>You may bring a parent or guardian, friend, or other chaperon if you wish. It is ideal for everyone's comfort level.</li>
                    </ol>
